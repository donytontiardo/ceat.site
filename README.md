The aptitude assessment website using Mamdani model fuzzy algorithm
This code is written on PHP and still pretty messed up.
I'm not using any hash or method to store password on the database so makes sure to use one before implementing it.
you can find a fuzzy algorithm in file with name "fuzzy" in front of it.
the fuzzy rules and parameters that are used is only for computer engineering student and was determined by the expert.
there are 2 final.php, the first one is shown the most optimal result and the other one is showing all the test result for the final.php page in website.
